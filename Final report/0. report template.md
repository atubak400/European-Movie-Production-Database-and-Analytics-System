## Final Report: Movie Production Database Project

# Executive Summary:
This report presents the results of the Movie Production Database Project, which aimed to create a database system for managing production companies, employees, films, and grants. The project was successful in achieving its objectives, including the design of a normalized and optimized database and the development of user-friendly front-end interfaces.

# Introduction:
The Movie Production Database Project was initiated to streamline data management for the movie production industry. It aimed to enhance the efficiency of managing production companies, their employees, films, and grants.

# Project Objectives:
The objectives of the project were to:

Create a normalized and optimized database design.
Develop user-friendly front-end interfaces.
Implement SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
Methodology:
The project followed a structured methodology involving entity relationship modeling, normalization, optimization, and front-end development. The chosen DBMS was MySQL, and Microsoft Access was selected as the front-end platform.

# Entity Relationship Model (ERM):
The ERM defined entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities, serving as the foundation for the database design.

# Database Implementation:
This section details the data types, constraints, candidate keys, and primary keys used in the database design.

# Front-End Development:
The front-end interfaces were developed using Microsoft Access forms, providing users with a user-friendly platform for interacting with the database.

# Query Statements:
Sample SQL queries were created for data retrieval, allowing for analysis of production companies, employees, films, and grants.

Data Insertion, Testing, and Finalization:
Data insertion procedures, testing results, and finalization processes are discussed.

# Normalization and Optimization:
The database design was normalized and optimized to eliminate data redundancy and improve performance.

# Results and Achievements:
The project achieved its objectives by delivering a functional and efficient database system with user-friendly interfaces.
