This Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Movie Production Database Project showcases a well-structured database model with multiple key entities and relationships.

At the core, "ProductionCompany" is a pivotal entity, recording essential information such as company name, address, organization type, employee count, and financial data.

"Employee" acts as a crucial link between production companies and other elements, containing employee details like name, birthdate, and contact information while establishing a foreign key connection with their respective companies.

The "Film" entity documents movie data, including a unique movie code, title, and initial release year.

"Grant" serves as a significant entity, tracking details of grants received by production companies, including grant titles, funding organizations, and monetary values.

In the context of film production, the "Crew" entity captures various crew roles, their descriptions, and associated bonuses, with connections to employees and films.

The "Staff" entity focuses on the internal operations of production companies, managing staff departments, building locations, wages, and working hours, while connecting to their respective companies.

"GrantApplication" records grant application data, featuring application dates, desired amounts, outcomes, and references to both grant titles and company names.

Lastly, "ContactInformation" comprehensively stores employees' contact details, including telephone numbers, national insurance numbers, and passport numbers, linking this data to the corresponding employees.
