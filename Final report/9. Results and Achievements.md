## Results and Achievements

The Movie Production Database Project has achieved significant milestones and delivered tangible outcomes that contribute to the enhancement of data management and decision-making within the movie production industry. This section outlines the key results and achievements of the project.

1. Comprehensive Data Management:

The database successfully captures and manages a wealth of information related to production companies, employees, films, and grants. It provides a centralized repository for all essential data points, ensuring that users can efficiently access and analyze relevant information.
2. Enhanced Data Integrity:

Through the principles of normalization and optimization, the project has significantly improved data integrity. Redundancy has been minimized, and data anomalies have been reduced, resulting in a database that is both accurate and reliable.
3. User-Friendly Front-End Interfaces:

The implementation of Microsoft Access forms for the front-end interfaces has created a user-friendly platform for stakeholders. Users can interact with the database effortlessly, input data, and retrieve information with ease.
4. Query Capabilities:

A set of sample SQL queries has been developed, allowing users to extract specific data from the database for analysis and reporting. These queries support data-driven decision-making within the industry.
5. Efficient Data Retrieval:

Optimization techniques, including indexing and query optimization, have significantly improved data retrieval performance. Users can access data swiftly, even with extensive datasets and complex queries.
6. Normalization for Data Consistency:

The application of normalization principles ensures that the database is organized into logical and consistent structures. This not only simplifies data management but also contributes to data consistency and reliability.
7. Data Analysis and Reporting:

The database is well-positioned for data analysis and reporting, supporting the project's objectives to offer valuable insights into the effects of funding and grants within the film industry.
8. Database for Informed Decision-Making:

The Movie Production Database Project provides an essential resource for stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions related to production companies, employees, films, and grants.
