## Project Objectives

> Database Design:

Create a normalized and optimized database structure to efficiently store and manage data related to production companies, their employees, films, and grants.
Define entities, attributes, relationships, and keys to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
Implement data types, constraints, candidate keys, and primary keys in accordance with the project's design specifications.


> Front-End Development:

Develop user-friendly front-end interfaces that provide intuitive data input, retrieval, and reporting capabilities.
Design and implement interfaces to enhance the user experience and streamline data management tasks.
Ensure seamless interaction between users and the database system, facilitating efficient data handling and retrieval.


> Data Analysis:

Create a set of SQL queries to facilitate data retrieval and analysis, enabling users to gain insights into various aspects of the movie production industry.
Develop queries that support informed decision-making, operational efficiency, and resource optimization.
Implement query statements for extracting relevant information about production companies' performance, employee roles, film data, and grant management.


> Normalization and Optimization:

Apply a structured normalization process to the database design, reducing data redundancy and ensuring data consistency.
Optimize the database schema to enhance data storage and retrieval performance, addressing performance-related concerns.
Database Management System (DBMS):

Select an appropriate Database Management System (DBMS) for efficient data storage and management, ensuring compatibility with the front-end platform.


> Documentation:

Create comprehensive documentation that outlines the entire database design and development process, making it accessible for future reference and maintenance.


> Testing and Quality Assurance:

Conduct thorough testing procedures to verify the accuracy and integrity of the database.
Identify and address any issues, anomalies, or errors within the database system.
Ensure that the front-end interfaces and query statements perform as expected.


> Results and Achievements:

Successfully deliver a functional and efficient database system that fulfills the project's objectives.
Provide users with a powerful tool for managing production company data, employee information, film details, and grant records.


> Conclusion:

Conclude the project with a stable and effective database solution that is expected to have a positive impact on the movie production industry.
Ensure that the system meets the specified requirements and provides a valuable resource for industry stakeholders.
