## Database Implementation

Database Implementation:

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the database's implementation, including the data types, constraints, candidate keys, and primary keys utilized in the design. It outlines the technical aspects of the database structure that ensure data integrity and robust management of information.

ProductionCompany Table:

The "ProductionCompany" table is a central entity in the database, representing movie production companies. It utilizes various data types to store company-related information, including text fields for company name, address, ZIP code, city, nation, and organization type. Numeric data types are employed for attributes like the number of employees and net value, while the registration date and office are recorded as dates and text, respectively. The "CompanyName" is designated as the primary key to uniquely identify each production company.
Employee Table:

The "Employee" table captures employee details and maintains relationships with production companies. Data types such as AutoNumber and text are used for the "EmployeeID," "GivenName," "Surname," "MiddleName," and "EmailAddress" attributes, ensuring unique identifiers and textual data for employee records. The "DateOfBirth" and "CommencementDate" are recorded as dates. The "CompanyName" field is associated with the "ProductionCompany" table through a foreign key constraint.
Film Table:

The "Film" table focuses on movie-related data. It employs data types such as text for the "MovieCode" and "Title" attributes, while "FirstReleaseYear" is stored as a numeric value. The "MovieCode" serves as the primary key to uniquely identify films.
Grant Table:

The "Grant" table tracks grant-related information, using text data types for "GrantTitle" and "FundingOrganization" and a currency data type for "MaxMonetaryValue." The "DeadlineForSubmission" is recorded as a date. The "GrantTitle" is designated as the primary key to ensure unique grant identification.
Crew Table:

The "Crew" table manages data related to various crew roles within film production. Text data types are used for "Role" and "RoleDescription," while the "Bonus" is stored as currency. AutoNumber is applied for the "EmployeeID" attribute to guarantee unique identifiers, and text is used for the "MovieCode" attribute. Foreign key constraints link "EmployeeID" to the "Employee" table and "MovieCode" to the "Film" table.
Staff Table:

The "Staff" table handles staff-related information within production companies. Text data types are employed for "Department," "Building," and "WorkingHours," while "MonthlyWage" is stored as currency. "CompanyName" is connected to the "ProductionCompany" table through a foreign key relationship.
GrantApplication Table:

The "GrantApplication" table records grant application details, including dates, desired amounts, and outcomes. Date and currency data types are used for "ApplicationDate" and "DesiredAmount," respectively. Text data types are employed for "Outcome," "GrantTitle," and "CompanyName." The "GrantTitle" and "CompanyName" attributes are linked to the "Grant" and "ProductionCompany" tables, respectively, using foreign key constraints.
ContactInformation Table:

The "ContactInformation" table stores employee contact details, employing text data types for "TelephoneNumber," "TelephoneNumberDescription," "NationalInsuranceNumber," and "PassportNumber." AutoNumber data types are used for "EmployeeID," establishing a foreign key relationship with the "Employee" table.
