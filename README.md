# European-Movie-Production-Database-and-Analytics-System

## Project Overview
The research team has requested the development of a database to support a project focused on movie production companies.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to employ machine learning, neural networks, and other methodologies to extract pertinent information regarding the status of movie production companies in Europe, as well as the overall condition of this industry within a specific group of countries, including the United Kingdom.

## Client's Commission
The research institute, whose identity will not be disclosed, has commissioned the development of a data analytics application as part of this project. Your responsibility lies in developing the central, server-side database that serves as the foundation for this application.

## Open Source Application
It is important to note that the application is intended to be open source, thereby ensuring its accessibility to a wide range of users.

## Section 2: Database Purpose

### Machine Learning Application
This is a machine learning application designed to operate on a database, with the objective of discerning the association between various facets of the industry. These facets encompass funding prospects as well as the establishment of novel production businesses or studios.

## Section 3: Company Information

### Company Data
The database comprehensively documents all production companies operating within the European region. It includes essential information such as the company's name, address, ZIP code, city, nation, kind of organisation (e.g., non-profit), number of employees, and net value, which is determined by subtracting total liabilities from total assets.

### Company Registration
Each production company is required to register its name with a single local government office, such as Companies House in the UK, on a designated date. It is possible for a company to have multiple shareholders. The regulatory body commonly necessitates the provision of certain details pertaining to shareholders.

### Registration Costs
Moreover, it is important to note that the registration process incurs a financial obligation, such as a fee of Â£12 in the United Kingdom.

## Section 4: Employee Data

### Employee Details
The database additionally stores the employees' data pertaining to each company, with the assumption that each employee is affiliated with a singular producing company. The categorization of people into crew and staff within movie production businesses is a result of the intricate organisational structure and the diverse range of talents and vocations required.

### Categorization of Crew and Staff
The crew comprises three primary factions: the actors, the director(s), and the individuals responsible for various other tasks associated with the production, such as producers, editors, production designers, costume designers, and composers, among others. All remaining personnel are categorised within the staff group, encompassing those who hold responsibilities in areas such as human resources, advertising, and other related functions.

### Employee Information
Employees are characterized by an employee identification number, their given name, surname, and maybe a middle name. Additionally, their date of birth and commencement date may be included. In addition, the contact information of every employee is documented, encompassing either a singular telephone number or several numbers, accompanied by a corresponding description for each entry. Every employee possesses a solitary email address as well.

### Compensation
The compensation for crew members is determined on an hourly basis, and this information is meticulously documented in the database, along with an additional incentive that is contingent upon the terms of their contractual agreement.

## Section 5: Film Information

### Film Details
The database comprehensively stores information on all films produced by each respective production firm. In a comprehensive manner, pertinent details pertaining to each movie are meticulously documented, including a universally unique movie code, akin to the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) utilized for books, the movie's title, as well as the year and first release date (excluding subsequent release dates, which are deemed inconsequential and hence should not be included in the record).

### Crew Involvement
Additionally, the database maintains a record of every crew person involved in the film, along with their respective responsibilities. It is possible for a crew member to assume one or more roles within the same film, and each position is accompanied by a corresponding description. In the context of film production, it is common for a movie to feature either a solitary protagonist or multiple protagonists. Additionally, it is not uncommon for an actor to portray one or multiple characters inside a film, or even make a brief appearance known as a cameo.

## Section 6: Funding and Grants

### Research Objective
One of the primary objectives of this research is to offer valuable insights into the effects of funding and grants within the film industry.

### Database Requirements
In order to achieve this objective, it is imperative that the database possesses the capability to comprehensively document all financial support received by each production business. The essential components to be included in the proposal are the grant's official title, the funding organization (e.g., a specific government or European Union funds like the ERDF), the maximum monetary value allocated for the award, and the specified deadline for proposal submission. Subsequently, the database should be designed to capture the application date, desired amount, and outcome (either successful or unsuccessful) for each company's grant application. A grant may be awarded to either a sole production company or distributed among multiple production companies.

## Section 7: Project Progress

### Next Steps
Upon completion of the database, the project will proceed to execute a series of machine learning algorithms in order to conduct comprehensive data analysis. This analysis will focus on the various grants and their respective impact, with the objective of examining the effects of such financing against a predetermined set of criteria. At this point of the project, no supplementary information has been provided.
