# Project Plan

## Week 1: Planning and Database Design
Day 1-2: Requirement Analysis
Review the project objectives and requirements.
Identify specific data entities and relationships.
Day 3-5: Entity Relationship Model (ERM)
Create an initial ERM diagram.
Define entities, attributes, and cardinalities.
Identify primary and foreign keys.
Day 6-7: Normalization and Optimization
Analyze the ERM for potential normalization improvements.
Optimize the database design to conform to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

## Week 2: Database Schema Implementation
Day 1-3: Data Types and Constraints
Define appropriate data types for each attribute.
Implement candidate keys and primary keys.
Set up CHECK constraints to ensure data integrity.
Day 4-5: Table Creation
Write SQL scripts to create database tables.
Ensure that tables include the necessary attributes and relationships.
Day 6-7: Front-End Development Choice
Decide on the front-end development platform/language.
If needed, set up the chosen platform.

## Week 3: Front-End Development and Query Statements
Day 1-4: Front-End Development
Begin creating the front-end interfaces.
Design forms or web-based UI for data entry and retrieval.
Day 5-7: Query Statements
Develop SQL query statements for data retrieval and reporting.
Ensure that queries meet the project's data analysis requirements.

## Week 4: Data Insertion, Testing, and Finalization
Day 1-3: Data Insertion and Testing
Write SQL statements for data insertion.
Populate the database with sample data for testing.
Test queries and the front-end interface for data retrieval.
Day 4-6: Update, Delete, and Final Testing
Implement SQL statements for data update and deletion.
Perform final testing to identify and fix any issues.
Day 7: Documentation and Review

> Document the database design and development process.
> Review the entire database and front-end system for quality and accuracy.
> By the end of this 4-week plan, you should have a fully functional database system with front-end interfaces that allow users to interact with the database effectively. The database should meet the specified objectives, including ERM design, normalization, performance optimization, and the ability to insert, update, delete, and query data.
